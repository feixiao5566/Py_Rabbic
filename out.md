I scrub at the base of it with vaseline
What's come over me
Hurry up and find out who you are
The crust in your temperament
 
 
I like to live with my head on your lap
There's no charge
Don't wash with me
What's come over me?
Frente! - What's Come over Me
 
Coming down on myself too easily
END
Be the most hurtful thing you did to me
I don't like to need that
Hurry up and find out who you are
What's come over me
What's come over me
Packing those stairs away could visibly
What's come over me?
Hurry up and find out who you are
 
There's no charge
What's come over me?
What's come over me
Hurry up and find out who you are
 
Hurry up and find out who you are
Hurry up and find out who you are
What's come over me?
Walking your muddy feet on my carpet
What's come over me
There's no charge
What's come over me?
There's no charge
What's come over me
There's no charge
I don't like to need that
 
 
 
 
 
 
There's no charge
 
 
How can you sleep with me so silently
